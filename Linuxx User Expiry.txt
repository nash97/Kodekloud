A developer javed has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for javed. Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with a set expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.


Therefore, create a user named javed on the App Server 2. Set expiry date to 2021-12-07 in Stratos Datacenter. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.

Solutions:-
Go to app2 server:- ssh steve@stapp02
Add user:- sudo useradd javed
Change expiry date:- sudo chage -E 2021-12-07 javed
To see all information of user javed :-sudo chage -l javed
