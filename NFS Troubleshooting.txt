The Nautilus production support team was trying to fix issues with their storage server. The storage server has a shared directory /app, which is mounted on all app servers at location /var/www/html so that whatever data they store on storage server under /app can be shared among all app servers. Somehow NFS server is broken and having some issues.


Identify the root cause of the issue and fix it to make sure sharing works fine among all app servers and storage server.


Solutions:-

1)Login to storage server-

ssh natasha@ststor01

2)Enable nfs-server and rcpbind-
sudo systemctl enable nfs-server 
sudo chkconfig nfs-server on
sudo systemctl enable rcpbind
sudo chkconfig rcpbind on

3)Start nfs server and rcpbind and check status

sudo systemctl start nfs-server && sudo systemctl status nfs-server

sudo systemctl start rpcbind && sudo systemctl status rpcbind

4)Now Edit Exports File

sudo vi /etc/exports

Write in vi editor
/app 172.16.238.10(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
/app 172.16.238.11(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
/app 172.16.238.12(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
 Press ESC Button and then type :wq!

5)Now type this command:-

sudo exportfs -a

6)Then run show mount command to check the listed servers

sudo showmount -e ststor01

7)Open 3 new terminals for 3 appservers and do the followings in every app server

Repeat enable, check config and start, status commands for nfs-server and rpcbind like you did in storage server

8)Next, mount and check nfs

mount -t nfs ststor01:/app /var/www/html
df -h
mount | grep nfs

Do this in all app servers and make sure that you have found nfs on mount with rw, realtime finally.
