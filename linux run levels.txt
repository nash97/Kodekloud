Q)New tools have been installed on the app server in Stratos Datacenter. Some of these tools can only be managed from the graphical user interface. Therefore, there are requirements for these app servers.
On all App servers in Stratos Datacenter change the default runlevel so that they can boot in GUI (graphical user interface) by default.



Steps:-
    1  ssh tony@stapp01 (Login to server)
    2  sudo systemctl get-default
    3  sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target
    4  sudo systemctl enable graphical.target
    5  sudo systemctl status graphical.target
    6  sudo systemctl start graphical.target
    7  sudo systemctl status graphical.target
